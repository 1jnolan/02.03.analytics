#PLOTTING GRAPHS

#import the pyplot interface from the matplotlib module
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# each time we want to use matplotlib.pyplot we would need to type out the full name.
# to avoid typing it out each time we rename it (like creating a variable)
# in this example matplotlib.pyplot is renames AS plt

myList=[1,19,27,8,5,9]
plt.plot(myList)
#takes in the list as an arguement - we can put in more than one.
#The .plot() uses the values in myList as the y-axis values.
#Because there is not a second list, pyplot uses the list index as the x axis numbers.

plt.show()
