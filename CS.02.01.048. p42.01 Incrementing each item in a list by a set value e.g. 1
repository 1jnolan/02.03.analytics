#Increment Each number in a list by 1

#Create the empty list

#As the user how many numbers they want to enter. e.g. 3
totalNumber= int(input("How many numbers do you want to enter: "))

#METHOD USING AN IF STATEMENT:
if totalNumber > 0:
    #create a range from the total numbers:
    for number in range(totalNumber):
        #ask the user to unput the number they want, this will be asked the number of times the totalNumber is set to.
      number= int(input("Enter your number: "))
      #Append each number the user enters to the list.  
      numberList.append(number)

 

print("Your numbers are now: ")

#Get a new range of data based on the totalNumber entered. e.g. 3
for number in range(totalNumber):
        #then for each number in the range e.g.3 find what is at position 0 and add 1 to it, and so on throughout the range of numbers.
       print(int(numberList[number]+1))
